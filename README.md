# hello-world
initial respository
My name is Cedrick Houston and I would like to start a career in software development.  I am new to coding but, I have a strong desire for learning to code. I always have.  I am presently going to school online at the University of Phoenix and I am working towards an Associates degree in computer programming. I look forward to gaining all the knowledge I can about coding and software development.
